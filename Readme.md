# Task 3. Deep Learning Based DNA Sequence Fast Decoding

Our work on this task consists of 2 stages:
1. Hyperparameter tuning
2. GPU cluster setting tuning

First, we search the optimal modification of the Leopard U-Net. The objective of this stage is to make the model achieve as high PR AUC as possible. After that, we move the optimal model to the second stage and compare the efficiency between different GPU cluster settings.
